Audio API: Importable ✅
Health API: Importable ✅
File Manager: Class name mismatch (AudioFileManager vs FileManager)
```

**Key Findings:**
- Core API structure functional
- Minor import issues easily fixable
- Ready for full testing after Essentia fix

## 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG ANALYSIS**

### **Bug: Essentia Random Device Path Length Error**

**Error Details:**
```
ValueError: random_device could not be read: File name too long
File: /mnt/2w12-data/miniconda3/envs/2w12-backend/lib/python3.10/site-packages/essentia/standard.py
Function: _reloadAlgorithms() → _create_essentia_class()
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Long conda environment path: `/mnt/2w12-data/miniconda3/envs/2w12-backend/`
- Essentia C++ library has path length limitations
- Affects random number generator initialization in Essentia algorithms

**Impact Assessment:**
- **High**: Blocks EssentiaAudioAnalyzer (4000x speedup potential)
- **Medium**: Prevents librosa replacement optimizations
- **Low**: Core ML models still functional via existing paths

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Environment variable approach**: Set TMPDIR to shorter path
2. **Symlink approach**: Create shorter path symlink to conda env
3. **Working directory approach**: Change to shorter path before import
4. **Alternative**: Use different Essentia initialization method
