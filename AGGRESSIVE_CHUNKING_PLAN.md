# Aggressive 10-Second Chunking Strategy

## 🚨 Current Performance Issues

### **Current Chunking (120s chunks):**
- ❌ **Chunk Size**: 120 seconds 
- ❌ **Processing Time**: 3+ minutes per chunk (2.5x slower than realtime)
- ❌ **Total Time**: 4min 37s for 3.5min file
- ❌ **GPU Underutilization**: Large chunks don't fully leverage GPU parallelism

### **Problem Analysis:**
- **Schirkoa file**: 209s duration, 57.5MB
- **Current chunks**: 2 chunks of 120s each
- **Per-chunk time**: 3+ minutes (way too slow!)
- **Bottleneck**: Even with parallelism, individual chunks are massive

## 🚀 Proposed Solution: 10-Second Aggressive Chunking

### **New Architecture:**
```
File: 209s duration
├── Chunk 1: 0-10s
├── Chunk 2: 10-20s  
├── Chunk 3: 20-30s
├── ...
└── Chunk 21: 200-209s

Processing: 8 chunks simultaneously in parallel batches
```

### **Expected Performance:**
| Metric | Current (120s chunks) | Proposed (10s chunks) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Chunk Size** | 120 seconds | 10 seconds | **12x smaller** |
| **Chunks per File** | 2 chunks | 21 chunks | **10x more parallel work** |
| **Parallel Processes** | 3-6 processes | 8 processes | **2x more parallelism** |
| **Per-chunk Time** | 3+ minutes | ~10-15 seconds | **12-18x faster** |
| **Total Time** | 4min 37s | **~45-60 seconds** | **5-6x faster** |
| **Realtime Factor** | 0.76x | **3-4x realtime** | **Real-time capable!** |

## 💻 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Optimize Chunk Size**
```python
def _chunked_parallel_analysis(self, y: np.ndarray, sr: int, tmp_file_path: str, 
                             file_info: Dict, filename: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    
    # AGGRESSIVE CHUNKING PARAMETERS
    chunk_duration = 10     # 10 seconds per chunk (was 120s)
    overlap_duration = 1    # 1 second overlap (was 10s)  
    max_parallel = 8        # 8 simultaneous processes (was 3)
    
    chunk_samples = int(chunk_duration * sr)
    overlap_samples = int(overlap_duration * sr)
```

### **Phase 2: Batch Processing Optimization**
```python
def process_chunks_in_batches(self, chunks: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Process chunks in optimized batches for GPU efficiency"""
    
    batch_size = 8  # Process 8 chunks simultaneously
    all_results = []
    
    # Use ProcessPoolExecutor for true parallelism (not just threading)
    from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
        for batch_start in range(0, len(chunks), batch_size):
            batch_chunks = chunks[batch_start:batch_start + batch_size]
            
            # Submit all chunk analyses to process pool
            futures = []
            for chunk in batch_chunks:
                future = executor.submit(self.analyze_chunk_fast, chunk)
                futures.append(future)
            
            # Collect results from this batch
            batch_results = [future.result() for future in futures]
            all_results.extend(batch_results)
            
            logger.info(f"✅ Processed batch {len(all_results)//batch_size}")
    
    return all_results
```

### **Phase 3: GPU Memory Optimization**
```python
def analyze_chunk_fast(self, chunk: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Ultra-fast analysis for 10-second chunks"""
    
    audio = chunk["audio"]
    sr = chunk["sr"]
    
    # LIGHTWEIGHT ANALYSIS for 10s chunks
    # Focus on GPU-accelerated ML, minimal CPU processing
    
    # 1. Fast Essentia ML (GPU) - Primary analysis
    ml_result = self.essentia_models.fast_analyze(audio, sr)
    
    # 2. Minimal librosa (CPU) - Only essential features  
    basic_result = self.fast_librosa_analysis(audio, sr)
    
    # 3. Skip expensive operations for small chunks
    # - No complex tempo analysis (use Madmom on full file)
    # - No complex harmonic analysis
    # - Focus on: key, energy, spectral features
    
    return {**ml_result, **basic_result, "chunk_id": chunk["id"]}
```

## 🎯 Optimization Strategies

### **1. GPU Batch Processing**
- **Process 8 chunks simultaneously** on GPU
- **Smaller chunks = better GPU utilization**
- **TensorFlow can handle multiple small inference calls efficiently**

### **2. CPU Task Reduction**
```python
def fast_librosa_analysis(self, y: np.ndarray, sr: int) -> Dict:
    """Minimal librosa for 10s chunks"""
    return {
        "energy": np.mean(np.abs(y)),                    # Super fast
        "spectral_centroid": np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr)),
        "duration": len(y) / sr
        # Skip: complex tempo, complex key, harmonic analysis
    }
```

### **3. Smart Aggregation**
```python
def aggregate_chunk_results(self, chunk_results: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    """Intelligent aggregation with temporal weighting"""
    
    # Weight recent chunks more heavily for dynamic music
    total_chunks = len(chunk_results)
    
    aggregated = {}
    for i, chunk_result in enumerate(chunk_results):
        # Linear weight: later chunks get more influence
        weight = (i + 1) / total_chunks
        
        for key, value in chunk_result.items():
            if key not in aggregated:
                aggregated[key] = []
            aggregated[key].append((value, weight))
    
    # Weighted average for numeric features
    final_result = {}
    for key, weighted_values in aggregated.items():
        if isinstance(weighted_values[0][0], (int, float)):
            weighted_sum = sum(val * weight for val, weight in weighted_values)
            weight_sum = sum(weight for val, weight in weighted_values)
            final_result[key] = weighted_sum / weight_sum
    
    return final_result
```
